        The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including
        the city of New Orleans. Celebrations are concentrated for about two
        weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday
        (the start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is
        one major parade each day (weather permitting); many days have several
        large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the
        last five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many events
        occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including
        parades and balls (some of them masquerade balls). The parades in New
        Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the
        same parade schedule and route each year. The earliest-established
        krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the Knights
        of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are
        well known for holding large parades and events, such as the Krewe of
        Endymion (which is best known for naming celebrities as grand marshals
        for their parades), the Krewe of Bacchus (similarly known for naming
        celebrities as their Kings), as well as the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure
        Club—a predominantly African American krewe. Float riders traditionally
        toss throws into the crowds. The most common throws are strings of
        colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon
        Pies, and small inexpensive toys. Major krewes follow the same parade
        schedule and route each year. While many tourists center their Carnival
        season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades originate in the
        Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles
        Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of the French Quarter.
        Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and Chewbacchus - also
        take place downtown in the Faubourg Marigny and French Quarter in the
        weekends preceding Mardi Gras day. Mardi Gras day traditionally
        concludes with the "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.
